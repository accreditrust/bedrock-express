# bedrock-express ChangeLog

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2015-06-23

### Added
- Parse both `application/json` and `application/*+json` as JSON. This will
  cause content with the type `application/ld+json`, for example, to be
  auto parsed as expected.

## [1.0.0] - 2015-04-08

### Changed
- Use cors 2.5.x.

## [0.2.0] - 2015-02-23

### Added
- Exposed middleware that must act like singletons, but may be configured by
more than one module, via a `middleware` object with keys that match the
middleware package name, eg: middleware['express-session'].

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Use express `4.x`.
- **BREAKING**: `express` property is no longer exposed on the express
application. To access this, require the `bedrock-express` module and use
its API directly.
- Unused `config.express.showStack` config option removed.
- Removed deprecated `config.server.static` config option.

## 0.1.0 - 2015-02-23

- See git history for changes.
